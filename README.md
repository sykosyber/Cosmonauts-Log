### **A Quiet Room at the Edge of the Void**

In the late hours, when the noise of the day finally recedes, the mind often yearns for a quiet, open space.

This is not a tool for productivity. It is not designed to make you faster, more efficient, or more connected. It will not help you manage your tasks or organize your workflow.

The Cosmonaut's Log is a sanctuary for the scattered signals of the self. It is a quiet space where stray thoughts, like raindrops, are free to collect and form a river.

We live in an age of digital noise, of interfaces designed to capture and hold our attention with relentless urgency. The Log is a small act of rebellion against this. It is an environment built on the principle of **Reflective Gravity**, a belief that depth and clarity arise from what we choose to exclude. Its power lies not in its features, but in their deliberate absence.

Enter the cabin. Let the low hum of the void quiet your mind. Watch the slow drift of distant stars. There is only one task here: to write. To think. To transmit. To listen to the signal that can only be heard when all other signals fall silent.

We offer this space not as a product, but as a refuge. A quiet room for the serious play of the soul.

What transmission will you send from the deep space of the self?

## Features
The Log's primary feature is its profound lack of features. It is an environment built for focus, not for functionality.

**Immersive Atmosphere:** A full-screen, distraction-free writing canvas set against a gently drifting starfield.

**Contemplative Soundscape:** A persistent, low-volume ambient hum layered with rare, atmospheric audio events to create a space for deep thought.

**Sounds of Earth:** An interface to the Voyager Golden Record, grounding your personal transmission in the collective human story.

**Apollo Radio:** Optional radio chatter from the Apollo missions to deepen the feeling of sublime, connected solitude.

**Tactile Controls:** A brutalist inspired settings panel with physical-feeling levers and dials for a deliberate user experience.

**Persistent Local State:** Your work is automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so you can always return to your transmission exactly as you left it.

**Zero Distractions. By Design.**

### Getting Started

The Cosmonaut's Log is a self-contained web application. To run it locally, you'll need to serve the files from a simple local web server due to browser security policies for loading audio assets.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Cosmonauts-Log.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Cosmonauts-Log
    ```

3.  **Start a local server.** Here are a few simple one-line options:

      * If you have **Node.js** installed, you can use the `npx` command:
        ```bash
        npx live-server
        ```
      * If you have **Python 3** installed:
        ```bash
        python3 -m http.server
        ```
      * Alternatively, and the easiest method, is to use a tool like the **"Live Server" extension** for VS Code.

4.  **Open in your browser:**
    Navigate to the local address provided by your server (usually `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).
